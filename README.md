# ScriptKnapper
## A JS library for generating code from templates

Scriptknapper is a Javascript library, designed to help you generate code/scripts from templates. There is a browser based UI, or you can use the library in a NodeJS script to automate the process.

For a basic understanding of how to use ScriptKnapper (and the Web UI), see the ScriptKnapper user guide in the documentation directory.

If you would like to use NodeJS to automate the code-generation process, then you should also see section 4 of the developer guide (also in the documentation directory). There are 3 functions in this section that you should look for: scriptKnapperMain, prepareTemplateString and buildTemplateJSON.
